\details{
rwm1984 is saved as a data frame. The data is typically used to model 
docvis, which is a count variable. It also may be used to model "outwork", 
a variable indicating if a patient is out-of-work. "outwork" is a binary 
variable which can be used as the response of a logistic or other binary 
response model.
