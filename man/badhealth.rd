\title{badhealth}
\description{A study of 1127 patients in which only three variables have been
selected. The data may be evaluated as a logistic or other binary response model
with the binary variable "badh" as the response. It may also be modeled as a count
model with "numvisit" (number of visits to a physician during the year) as the
response. "age" is an adjustor, and should be centered or standardized when
used in the model.

\usage{data(badhealth)}
\format{
  A data frame with 1127 observations with 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{numvisit}}{Number of visits to a physician during the year: 0 - 40}
    \item{\code{badh}}{0=patient evaluates self as in good health; 1=patient in bad health}
    \item{\code{age}}{patient age: 20 - 60}

\details{
badhealth is saved as a data frame.
