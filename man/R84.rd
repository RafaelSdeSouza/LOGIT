\description{
German health reform data for the year 1984. Subset of a multiyear
registry evaluating differences in physician provider utilization
prior to and after health reform legislation in the late 1980s.
R84 is identical to rwn1984.

\details{
R84 is saved as a data frame. The data is typically used to model
docvis, which is a count variable. It also may be used to model "outwork",
a variable indicating if a patient is out-of-work. "outwork" is a binary
variable which can be used as the response of a logistic or other binary
response model. R84 is identical to rwm1984.
